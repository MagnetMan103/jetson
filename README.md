# This is the repo for my lab hexapod robot jetson code.
It's mostly developmental, the main reason is public is so I don't have to deal with auth tokens

## 1/26/26

the controller folder is an attempt at adding video streaming (would crash jetson nano)

the root file bottle_controller.py does the same thing without video streaming
it can be run using

``` python3 bottle_controller.py ```
